-The JSON structure for  information retrieved from the space x API can be viewed on their gitHub here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API

I made this application because I recently have been playing around with the Shopify API and tried out their create a react app (part of their devPartners platform) and it utilizes alot of the same core technology here such as Apollo and GraphQL. 

The basis of this App is simply that, I wanted to be able to see information related to past SpaceX Launches.
I wanted to know the mission names, the rocket names, the dates, and whether they were successful as well as view images or the launch itself. The SpaceX API has All of this and more! 
I used an express based server querried via graphQL. Apollo is the mechanism by which the querries are triggered. There's alot more I hope to add here, so stay tuned. 

Unforutnately the earlier launches don't have photos but check out the newer launches further down on the page. Some excellent imagery!
